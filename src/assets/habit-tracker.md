🌱 How I Built a Fully Functional Habit Tracker App Using Laravel, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP
Introduction
Have you ever wanted to build something that actually helps people change their lives?

That's exactly what I set out to do when I decided to build a Habit Tracker web app. Not only was this project a great way to practice Laravel and Tailwind CSS, but it also taught me how to integrate smooth animations with GSAP and design an intuitive UI that motivates users to stay consistent.

In this blog post, I'm going to walk you through:

How I structured the database

The core features I implemented

The challenges I faced (and how I solved them)

How I used Laravel Blade and Tailwind to create a responsive UI

Where GSAP animations fit in to make everything pop

And finally, how you can build this yourself or extend it further

Let’s get into it!

🛠️ Technologies Used
Before diving into the build, here’s a quick overview of the tech stack:

Laravel (v10) – For backend logic, authentication, routing, and data management

Tailwind CSS – For responsive and utility-first styling

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) – For animating progress bars and other UI elements

MySQL – As the database

Blade – Laravel’s templating engine

🚀 Why Build a Habit Tracker?
There are hundreds of habit trackers out there, right?

Well, yes. But most of them are:

Either too complex (overloaded with features), or

Not flexible/customizable enough

As a developer, I wanted a lightweight, web-based tool where users could:

Add custom habits

Mark them daily

Visualize their progress clearly

And feel a little joy when they hit streaks (thanks to GSAP animations)

🧱 Database Structure
Here's how I structured the database:

Migrations
php
Copy
Edit
Schema::create('habits', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->unsignedBigInteger('user_id');
    $table->string('name');
    $table->text('description')->nullable();
    $table->timestamps();
});
php
Copy
Edit
Schema::create('habit_completions', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->unsignedBigInteger('habit_id');
    $table->date('completed_on');
    $table->timestamps();
});
This structure allows users to track daily completions for each habit. Each record in habit_completions marks a habit as completed on a particular day.
